# Snakes_Game
Snake is a classic game that includes a growing line represented as a snake that can consume items, change direction, and grow in length. As the snake grows larger in length, the difficulty of the game grows.

## Rules to play the game
* Don’t hit a wall and don’t bite your own tail.
* Crashing into a wall or your tail will end the game immediately.
* 10 points will be added to the player’s score for eating the fruit (#).
* The player’s total score is calculated based on the number of fruits the snake consumed.
* The length of the snake will be increased after eating the fruits.
* Use w, a, s, d to move the snake.
